# RuntimeASLR

RuntimeASLR is a tool to defeat the clone-probing attacks (e.g., [BlindROP][brop]) by re-randomizing
the memory layout of the cloned (i.e., forked) child process at runtime.
RuntimeASLR consists of three components: 
  - policy generator: automatically generates pointer tracking policy; 
  - pointer tracker: accurately tracks all pointers at runtime, guided by the generated tracking policy;
  - rerandomizer: remap all modules to random addresses, update all pointers, and transfer control.

Currently, it only supports x86_64.
RuntimeASLR is built based on Intel's Pin--a dynamic instrumentation tool. Since the 
pointer tracker will be completely detached after re-randomization, RuntimeASLR does not
impose performance overhead to the child process.
We have applied RuntimeASLR to Nginx web server and shown that BlindROP is defeated.

### Build RuntimeASLR
Easy to build:
```
$ cd <root dir of RuntimeASLR>
$ ./build-all.sh
```

### Run Nginx with RuntimeASLR
```
$ ./run.sh
```
Please have a look at run.sh to see individual steps to use RuntimeASLR.
